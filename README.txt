This project serves as a dynamic simulation for a music store, catering to users with distinct roles (admin and guest). 
It offers a simulated purchasing experience for songs based on individual search results. 
The system incorporates an SQLite database to securely store user information and temporarily house data retrieved from the iTunes API, streamlining data management.
All users can search, preview, and buy songs, but the admin user holds special privileges. 
The admin can view detailed information about all users and has the authority to delete user accounts and reset the total amount spent by each user.
